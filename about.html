                    <p>Yayoi Kusama's artistic path was shaped by a haunting childhood hallucination—a field of talking
                        flowers transformed into endless dots that swallowed her existence. This strange encounter had
                        an
                        indelible impact on her later work. Kusama's all-over marks and dots aim to dissolve boundaries,
                        fusing herself and her creations with the vast universe. Polka dots, to her, represent a path to
                        infinity, a unity with our surroundings. By obliterating nature and bodies with dots, she
                        invites us
                        to consider our place as a single polka dot among countless stars, merging into the
                        interconnected
                        fabric of existence. Experience the profound connection and limitless possibilities of Kusama's

                    <p>Yayoi Kusama defied her parents' wishes to pursue her artistic career. Even when her drawings
                        were
                        ripped up, she persisted, making do with mud and old sacks when art supplies were scarce. She
                        persuaded her parents to let her study painting at art school, determined to make her mark. She
                        moved to New York in the late 1950s and immersed herself in the city's vibrant art scene. Her
                        "infinity net" paintings, distinguished by repetitive marks that extended beyond the canvas,
                        pushed
                        the boundaries of painting and anticipated Minimalism. Meetings with influential artists such as
                        Donald Judd and Andy Warhol fueled Kusama's artistic journey even further. She became a
                        multidisciplinary creative force, experimenting with music, design, writing, and fashion. </p>
